<h3 class="aboutmeh3">Emma. Trekkie. Gamer. Cosplayer.</h3>
<p class="aboutmep">I'm somewhat of a huge geek. It started at a young age, back when technology was first showing a sharp upward curve.
  My first console was when I was around 6, the NES. I then went on to have the SNES, Gameboy (with one of those amazing clip on MAGNIFIERS 
  with a light so you could see better, yikes.) Then came the fabled PS1.(I skipped N64 and Sega), followed by the PS2 which kept me going 
  until my first gaming PC in around 2004.<br><br>
  
  I started cosplaying in 2017 when my friend convinced me to make a cosplay for Comiccon Stockholm, 
(check out my Cosplay tab for more info) and was hooked after that. I'm still a newbie, but I love crafting!<br><br>

  When it comes to games, as mentioned my console life was rich for its time! Some favourites are Zelda on SNES, to Final Fantasy 7 on PS1, 
  Final Fantasy 8, World of Warcraft, ARK: Survival Evolved, 7 Days 2 Die, Overwatch and Apex Legends.<br><br>

  My favourite Star Trek is Voyager, it is what I grew up with (TOS is a bit before my time, and TNG didn't catch my eye much). My mum and I 
  would watch it every week (back when you had 4 channels and had to read the TV guide to know when to be at your TV or when to set the VHS recorder!) 
  I have enjoyed the more recent films, as well as Discovery and Picard. Can't wait to see what comes next from Trek land!
