        <p class="textp">Following the sound of water, the trees around you slowly start to dissipate, until you reach a clearing in the forest. 
                        The sun shines brightly here, bathing the open area in a warm light. Birds can be heard singing and moving in the trees around you. 
                        In front of you is a cheerful bubbling <span class="orange">Stream</span>. 
                        Out of the corner of your eye you notice something shining on a nearby <span class="orange">Tree</span>. 
                        You can exit the clearing to the <span class="green">West</span>.
        </p>
        <!-- for the "Look Stream" command:
    <p class="textp"> The stream before you is crystal clear, allowing you to gaze down to the rocky bottom below. Brightly coloured fish dart around just below the surface,
         seemingly unaware of your presence. As you look upstream, you notice that there is a mountain range not too far in the distance and the stream appears to have run down from there. 
         This water is definitely drinkable. </p>-->

        <!-- for the "Look Tree" command:
    <p class="textp"> You glance up at the tree to get a better look at the shimmering that caught your attention. 
        Stuck in one of the branches is a <span class="yellow">Key</span> dangling from a frayed piece of leather. It looks like it has been there a while. </p>-->
