# FirstEverProject (Solo project)


This was the very first thing i tried making, with little introduction to HTML and CSS.

I still tried to be a bit fancy and used a background image, moved the links to good positions on the page in relation to the background, and each link contained anparagraph of information, with an image to the side of it.

This was as good as it got with the knowledge I had, and the time I had to do it in. I knew that the way i was positioning the links (using px) meant the page had zero responsiveness, but I went with what I had in my artillery. I received feedback on colour schemes and how to take care of the ease of reading for the user, but at this point my CSS knowledge was so little that I was simply picking random colours for backgrounds and text.

I learned how to link pages, change fonts, add background images and insert images onto the page. I learned about pixel positioning, anchor, headers and paragraph tags.
